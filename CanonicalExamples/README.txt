These are supposed to be idealized examples of gates. They're really just
MIT XML files, but given a different extension to indicate their purpose.
They also indicate they "key stroke" for each shape, which is used in
alignment. To indicate which stroke is "key", simply set its color to be
red.

Somebody should probably remake these to be more ideal and less "James Brown
drew this in 2 minutes".
